    Parse and process grid-connected hydrogen electrolysis supply data.

    This function processes regional hydrogen electrolysis capacity data, calculates
    regional distributions, and redistributes unmapped capacities based on existing
    regional patterns.

    Args:
        regional_gb_data_path (str): Path to the regional GB data CSV file containing
                                   hydrogen electrolysis capacity data by region and year.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: Processed grid-connected electrolysis capacities with MultiIndex
                     ['bus', 'year'] and 'data' values in original units in MW.
                     Includes both originally mapped capacities and redistributed
                     unmapped capacities.

    Processing steps:
        1. Filter regional data for hydrogen electrolysis technology
        2. Group mapped data by bus (region) and year
        3. Calculate regional distribution proportions for each year
        4. Identify and aggregate unmapped capacities (NaN bus values)
        5. Redistribute unmapped capacities based on regional distribution patterns
        6. Combine mapped and redistributed capacities into final dataset
